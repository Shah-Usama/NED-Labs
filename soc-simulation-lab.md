## Objectives of the Lab:
- To Learn the implementation of SOC (Security operation center) using simulator.
- To report the true positive and false positive lab cases to the alert center. 

## Implementation Tasks:
1. Launch SOC (Security operation center) simulator.
   SOC Simulator dashboard will be launched and started to analyze the alerts as shown in the following figure.

2. Go to the alert queue to assign the actions as decisions on priority basis.
